## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please send an email to feunixwork@gmail.com. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

## Security Measures

### Environment Variables
- All sensitive API keys are stored in environment variables
- `.env` file is gitignored to prevent accidental exposure
- Use `.env.example` as a template for required environment variables

### API Security
- API keys are validated before use
- Fallback mechanisms in place for API failures
- No sensitive data is logged in production

### Dependencies
- Regular dependency updates using `npm audit`
- Only trusted packages from npm registry
- Development dependencies separated from production

## Best Practices

1. **Never commit API keys** to version control
2. **Regularly update dependencies** to patch security vulnerabilities
3. **Use HTTPS** for all external API calls
4. **Validate user inputs** in all components
5. **Implement proper error handling** to prevent information leakage
